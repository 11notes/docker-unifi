${{ content_synopsis }} This image will provide you a rock solid<sup>1</sup> Unifi controller with included MongoDB (no separate image needed, since its EOL anyway).

${{ content_uvp }} Good question! All the other images on the market that do exactly the same don’t do or offer these options:

${{ github:> [!IMPORTANT] }}
${{ github:> }}* This image runs as 1000:1000 by default, most other images run everything as root
${{ github:> }}* This image is created via a secure, pinned CI/CD process and immune to upstream attacks, most other images have upstream dependencies that can be exploited
${{ github:> }}* This image contains a proper health check that verifies the app is actually working, most other images have either no health check or only check if a port is open or ping works
${{ github:> }}* This image has an auto update feature that will automatically build the latest version if released, most other image providers do this too slow

If you value security, simplicity and the ability to interact with the maintainer and developer of an image. Using my images is a great start in that direction.

# DISCLAIMERS
* <sup>1</sup> This image will automatically disable anonymous telemetry collected by Ubiquiti by adding a flag (`config.system_cfg.1=system.analytics.anonymous=disabled`) to each sites `config.properties`. You will still have to disable telemetry in the global settings too, to disable *all* telemetry. You can check your telemetry status by SSH’ing into an access point and checking ` grep analytics /tmp/system.cfg`, the output should read `disabled`. Make sure to also DNS block the FQDN `trace.svc.ui.com` in your DNS blocker.
