# DISCLAIMERS
* <sup>1</sup> This image will automatically disable anonymous telemetry collected by Ubiquiti by adding a flag (`config.system_cfg.1=system.analytics.anonymous=disabled`) to each sites `config.properties`. You will still have to disable telemetry in the global settings too, to disable *all* telemetry. You can check your telemetry status by SSH’ing into an access point and checking ` grep analytics /tmp/system.cfg`, the output should read `disabled`. Make sure to also DNS block the FQDN `trace.svc.ui.com` in your DNS blocker.
