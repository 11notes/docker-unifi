# SYNOPSIS 📖
**What can I do with this?** This image will give you a rootless and lightweight Sonarr installation. Sonarr is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.

# UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION 💶
**Why should I run this image and not the other image(s) that already exist?** Good question! All the other images on the market that do exactly the same don’t do or offer these options:

> [!IMPORTANT]
>* This image runs as 1000:1000 by default, most other images run everything as root
>* This image is created via a secure, pinned CI/CD process and immune to upstream attacks, most other images have upstream dependencies that can be exploited
>* This image contains a proper health check that verifies the app is actually working, most other images have either no health check or only check if a port is open or ping works

If you value security, simplicity and the ability to interact with the maintainer and developer of an image. Using my images is a great start in that direction.
