run unifi rootless

# SYNOPSIS 📖
**What can I do with this?** This image will provide you a rock solid<sup>1</sup> Unifi controller with included MongoDB (no separate image needed, since its EOL anyway).

# UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION 💶
**Why should I run this image and not the other image(s) that already exist?** Good question! All the other images on the market that do exactly the same don’t do or offer these options:

> [!IMPORTANT]
>* This image runs as 1000:1000 by default, most other images run everything as root
>* This image is created via a secure, pinned CI/CD process and immune to upstream attacks, most other images have upstream dependencies that can be exploited
>* This image contains a proper health check that verifies the app is actually working, most other images have either no health check or only check if a port is open or ping works
>* This image has an auto update feature that will automatically build the latest version if released, most other image providers do this too slow

If you value security, simplicity and the ability to interact with the maintainer and developer of an image. Using my images is a great start in that direction.

# MAIN TAGS 🏷️
These are the main tags for the image. There is also a tag for each commit and its shorthand sha256 value.

* [10.0.160](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/unifi/tags?name=10.0.160)
* [10.0.160-unraid](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/unifi/tags?name=10.0.160-unraid)

### There is no latest tag, what am I supposed to do about updates?
It is my opinion that the ```:latest``` tag is a bad habbit and should not be used at all. Many developers introduce **breaking changes** in new releases. This would messed up everything for people who use ```:latest```. If you don’t want to change the tag to the latest [semver](https://semver.org/), simply use the short versions of [semver](https://semver.org/). Instead of using ```:10.0.160``` you can use ```:10``` or ```:10.0```. Since on each new version these tags are updated to the latest version of the software, using them is identical to using ```:latest``` but at least fixed to a major or minor version. Which in theory should not introduce breaking changes.

If you still insist on having the bleeding edge release of this app, simply use the ```:rolling``` tag, but be warned! You will get the latest version of the app instantly, regardless of breaking changes or security issues or what so ever. You do this at your own risk!

# REGISTRIES ☁️
```
docker pull 11notes/unifi:10.0.160
docker pull ghcr.io/11notes/unifi:10.0.160
docker pull quay.io/11notes/unifi:10.0.160
```

# UNRAID VERSION 🟠
This image supports unraid by default. Simply add **-unraid** to any tag and the image will run as 99:100 instead of 1000:1000 causing no issues on unraid. Enjoy.

# DISCLAIMERS
* <sup>1</sup> This image will automatically disable anonymous telemetry collected by Ubiquiti by adding a flag (`config.system_cfg.1=system.analytics.anonymous=disabled`) to each sites `config.properties`. You will still have to disable telemetry in the global settings too, to disable *all* telemetry. You can check your telemetry status by SSH’ing into an access point and checking ` grep analytics /tmp/system.cfg`, the output should read `disabled`. Make sure to also DNS block the FQDN `trace.svc.ui.com` in your DNS blocker.
